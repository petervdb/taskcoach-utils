General information
========
This repository contains some additional tools to be used in comination with Tashcoach (http://taskcoach.org)
The goals I want to achieve with these tools are:
- being able to translate Taskcoach xml format to JSON format
- export Taskcoach files to NoSQL system like MongoDB
- export Taskcoach files to relational database systems like MySQL/MariaDB and MSSQL
- create synchronisation mechanism to centralize taskcoach files
- ...

History
=======
* 2014-09-29 Repository created. Nothing much to see yet.
* 2014-10-03 Script taskcoach_2_mongodb.py is able to export tasks to a MongoDB database. Script is still very immature.
